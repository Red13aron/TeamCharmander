// Regarding Choice of Transportation

// Need to create input field in HTML for allowing user to select between types of transportation
// Need to create a new variable travelMethod that will store user input for type of transportation they've chosen
// In queryURL const for the mapquest api we'll need to append a parameter for specifying the route type:

// &transportMode=|Values can be: AUTO, WALKING, or BICYCLE| + travelMethod
